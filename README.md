# ðŸŽ§ Spotify Hybrid Recommender System
> A hybrid recommendation engine that suggests personalized songs based on both audio features (content) and userâ€“song interactions (collaborative filtering).
Built using **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, and the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db).

## Project Overview

This project combines two popular recommendation techniques:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - Uses audio features such as *danceability, energy, valence, tempo,* etc.
   - Finds similar tracks using cosine similarity via `NearestNeighbors`.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Simulates userâ€“song rating data.
   - Learns hidden user and song representations using **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**.

3. **Hybrid Recommendation**
   - Merges both approaches using a tunable weight `Î±`:
     ```
     final_score = Î± * content_score + (1 - Î±) * collaborative_score
     ```
